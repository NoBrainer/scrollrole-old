        description:
          - >
            In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
          - >
            While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:\n
            - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n
            - When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as
            you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.\n
            - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
          - >
            If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
          - >
            Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
            haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your
            rage on your turn as a bonus action.
          - >
            Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian
            table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

              - >
                Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.
                When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you
                advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you
                have advantage until your next turn.

                edge when you dodge away from danger.
              - >
                You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and
                spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

                At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or
                the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
                features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

                  - >
                    For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end - that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker
                    is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in
                    the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

            description:

                Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If
                you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a
                bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
                of exhaustion (as described in appendix PH-A).

                Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed
                or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the
                rage.

            description:
              - >
                Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing
                presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the
                creature can see or hear you, it must succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
                proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
                next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this
                effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the
                creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
              - >
                If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature
                again for 24 hours.

                points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If
                you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
              - >
                Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long

            Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you
            pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
            spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
            bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

            You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to
            choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one
            Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.
          - >
            Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability
            check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
            deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds
            or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
            Inspiration die at a time.
          - >
            You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You
            regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
          - >
            Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at

                Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies
                during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points
                at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regain an extra

                At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, such as the
                College of Lore. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

                    Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from
                    sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or
                    elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.
                    When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they
                    held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the
                    king.
                  - >
                    The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or
                    following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the
                    bard would rather be honest than politic.
                  - >
                    The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms
                    and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of
                    state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of
                    authority.

               and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an
               ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic
               Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.
               You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines
               whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The
               creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.
