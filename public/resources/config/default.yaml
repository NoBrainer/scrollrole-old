  ## ACOLYTE
  - name: Acolyte
    description:
      - >
        You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an
        intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices
        in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric - performing
        sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
      - >
        Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in
        "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your
        religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the
        sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way?
        Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group
        that served a fiendish master that you now deny.
    proficiencies:
      - { type: skill, name: Insight }
      - { type: skill, name: Religion }
    equipment:
      - holy symbol
      - prayer book or prayer wheel

      - vestments
      - a set of common clothes
      - a pouch containing 15gp

      - name: Shelter of the Faithful
        description:
          - >
            As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform religious
            ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at
            a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material
            components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest
            lifestyle.
          - >
            You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
            residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a
            temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon priests for assistance,
            provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

    suggestedCharacteristics:
      description:
        - Pick two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw.
      personalityTrait:
        - I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.
        - I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.
        - I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.
        - Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.
        - I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.
        - I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.
        - I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.
        - >
          I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside
          world.
      ideal:
        - Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)
        - Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good)
        - Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaos)
        - Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful)
        - >
          Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well.
          (Lawful)
        - >
          Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by matching my actions against his or her
          teachings. (Any)
      bond:
        - I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.
        - I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.
        - I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.
        - Everything I do is for the common people.
        - I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.
        - I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.
      flaw:
        - I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
        - I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.
        - My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
        - I am inflexible in my thinking.
        - I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
        - Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.

  ## CUSTOMIZED BACKGROUND

        You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or campaign
        setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and
        choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the
        equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you
        spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality
        traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background,
        work with your GM to create one.

            In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
          - >
            While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
            (a) You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws;
            (b) When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases
            as you gain levels as a barbarian;
            (c) You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
          - >
            If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
          - >
            Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
            haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your
            rage on your turn as a bonus action.

            Once you have used all of your rages, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

                Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.
                When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you
                advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you
                have advantage until your next turn.

                At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an
                edge when you dodge away from danger.
              - >
                You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and
                spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

                the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
                features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

                    For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end - that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker
                    is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in
                    the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

                Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If
                you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a
                bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
                of exhaustion (as described in appendix PH-A).

                Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed

                Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing
                presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the
                creature can see or hear you, it must succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
                proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
                next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this
                effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the
                creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
              - >
                If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature

            spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
            bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

            You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to
            choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one
            Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.
          - >
            Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability
            check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
            deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds
            or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
            Inspiration die at a time.
          - >
            You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You
            regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

            Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at
            5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

                    Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from
                    sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or
                    elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.
                    When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they
                    held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the
                    king.
                  - >
                    The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or
                    following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the
                    bard would rather be honest than politic.
                  - >
                    The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms
                    and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of
                    state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of
                    authority.

               ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic
               Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.
               You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines
               whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The

            Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The
            Common word for such meditation is "trance".) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams
            are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this
